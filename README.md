# Raspberry Pi Projects

This is a collection of notes and scripts for different projects.  Some of these notes are collections or revisions of other people's notes on setting up the same given device.  Not all of them work out of the box, so I'm updating them with modifications required to work.  Also trying to attempt to site as many original sources as possible in the notes.
